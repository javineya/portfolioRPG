My Coding Portfolio - Not-So-Serious Edition

This is my third iteration of a portfolio site to showcase my skills as a developer. The first two were dreadfully boring. So boring that I haven't even bothered bringing them into GitHub. I had looked at award-winning portfolios and many examples of "great" portfolios for inspiration when I made them, but I didn't feel like they stood out enough for me to call the my own. Ultimately, I decided that I wanted my portfolio to showcase myself as much as my coding accolades, and it was easy to answer the question, "What things do I love?"

Gaming, of course. So I modeled my portfolio site on an RPG character screen, with an item inventory, quests, and details.

I'm using React and Redux, though I'm not 100% sure that Redux is necessary. My state is not dynamic and the site has a one-way flow of animations and information, for the most part. I could probably manage without Redux, but I like the idea of having my state in one place. Perhaps I'll optimize it later and do away with Redux, but it stays for now.

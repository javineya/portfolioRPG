My Coding Portfolio - Not-So-Serious Edition

This is my third iteration of a portfolio site to showcase my skills as a developer. The first two were dreadfully boring. So boring that I haven't even bothered bringing them into GitHub. I looked at award-winning portfolios and many examples of great portfolios for inspiration when I made the first two, but I didn't feel like they stood out enough for me to call them my own. Ultimately, I decided that I wanted my portfolio to showcase myself as much as my coding skills, and it was easy to answer the question, "What things do I love?"

Gaming, of course. So I modeled my portfolio site on an RPG character screen, with an item inventory, quests, and details.

I'm using React and Redux, though I'm not 100% sure that Redux is necessary. My state is not dynamic and the site has a one-way flow of animations and information, for the most part. I could probably manage without Redux, but I like the idea of having my state in one place. Perhaps I'll optimize it later and do away with Redux, but it stays for now.

EDIT: Wow! 2 years flies by when you're studying for a super important language test AND there's a global pandemic. It's been so long that I decided to revamp this project. I read about Gatsby and wanted to try it, so this project is dead, and I'm picking at its bones to supply the new project with components and stuff.
